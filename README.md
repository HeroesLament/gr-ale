gr-ale
====

gr-ale is MIL-STD-188-141a (ALE 2G) decoding block for gnuradio


Usage
-----

The block accepts float input from an USB demod sampled at 8000hz and outputs decoded data to stdout.

It is also capable of recording voice traffic after 3-step ALE handshake is detected for a preconfigured period of time.


Known problems
--------------

Incomplete support of ALE protocol features, currently only sounding and call establishment are decoded

There is a nice python multi-channel ALE decoder under examples/ directory. On my machine (six-core AMD bulldozer) it can decode ~22 channels before librtlsdr starts complaining about overruns.
